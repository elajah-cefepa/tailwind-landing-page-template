            <span className='font font-semibold'>That “all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,” </span> 
            by which we understand the whole of the Book called THE BIBLE; that it is inerrant in the original writing and that its teaching and authority is absolute, supreme, and final; that the Holy Spirit guided the holy men of old in all that they wrote. II Peter 1:21; Exodus 20:1; II Timothy 3:16; Acts 1:16; I Thessalonians 2:13; I Corinthians 2:11-14; I Corinthians 14:37; II Samuel 23:2.

            <span className='font font-semibold'>The Godhead eternally exists in three persons–the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. </span> 
            These three are one God, having the same nature, attributes, and perfection. John 10:30,36; Galatians 4:6; Acts 2:17,18; Genesis 1:26; Genesis 3:22; Genesis 11:7; Isaiah 6:8; Matthew 3:16,17; Matthew 28:19; John 14:6; II Corinthians 13:14.

John 1:1-3; John 1:14; Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 2:9; Matthew 1:16-25; Luke 1:31; Luke 2:7,11; Galatians 4:4; Hebrews 1:8; Hebrews 2:14; Titus 2:13; John 10:30,38; John 5:17-23; Revelation 1:8; Revelation 22:12,13; Hebrews 1:1-3; John 17:5; I Timothy 3:16; Colossians 1:9.

            , the source and power of all acceptable worship and service, the infallible interpreter of the infallible Word, Who indwells every true believer and is ever present to testify of Christ, seeking to occupy us with Him and not with ourselves or our experiences. John 15:26; Romans 8:26,27; Ephesians 4:30; Acts 13:2; John 16:13-15; I Corinthians 12:13; I Corinthians 3:16; I Corinthians 6:19; Romans 8:9; I Corinthians 2:14; I John 2:27; Acts 5:3; Ephesians 1:13,14; II Cor. 5:5.

            <span className='font font-semibold'>Man was created in the image of God, after His likeness</span>
            , as stated in the Word of God, but the whole human race fell in the fall of the first Adam. Not only was his moral nature grievously injured by the fall but he totally lost all spiritual life, becoming dead in trespasses and sins, and subject to the power of the devil. “…the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God” (Romans 8:7,8). Therefore, he cannot see nor enter the kingdom of God until he is born again by the Holy Spirit. That no degree of reformation however great, no attainment in morality however high, no culture however attractive, no humanitarian and philanthropic schemes and societies however useful, no baptism or other ordinance however administered, can help the sinner to take even one step toward heaven; but a new nature imparted from above, a new life implanted by the Holy Spirit through the Word is absolutely essential to salvation. John 3:3-8; Titus 3:5; Ephesians 2:1-3; II Corinthians 5:17; John 1:12,13; I John 5:1; Acts 4:12; John 14:6; Psalms 53:1-3; Isaiah 64:6; I John 5:19; Romans 3:1-23; Galatians 3:22; Ephesians 2:1-3; Jeremiah 13:23; Mark 7:20-23; Psalm 51:5; <br />Romans 5:12; Jeremiah 17:9.

          <p className="text-jusitfy md:text-md pt-4">
            <span className='font font-semibold'>That Jesus Christ became the sinner’s substitute before God and died as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sin of the whole world</span>
            ; that He was made a curse for the sinner, dying for his sins according to the Scriptures; that no repentance, no feeling, no faith, no good resolutions, no sincere efforts, no submission to the rules and regulations of any church can add in the very least to the value of the precious blood, or to the merit of that finished work, wrought for us by Him, Who tasted death for every man. Isaiah 53:2; John 1:19; II Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 9:28; I Peter 2:24; I Peter 3:18; Colossians 2:14; I Corinthians 15:1-3; Romans 3:26; Romans 5:6-8; Galatians 3:13; Romans 3:25; Colossians 1:20,21; Colossians 2:10; <br />Acts 13:38,39; Romans 3:22; I Corinthians 6:9-11.

            ; that His body was raised from the dead according to the Scriptures and that He ascended into Heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God as the believer’s High Priest and Advocate. Acts 10:40,41; I Corinthians 15:3-6; Romans 4:25; Mark 16:9-11; Mark 16:14-18; John 20:11-29; Acts 1:1-3; Acts 2:23,24; Acts 3:13-15; I Corinthians 9:1; Acts 1:9-11; Romans 8:34; Ephesians 1:20,21; Ephesians 2:6; Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 4:14; Hebrews 7:25; Acts 7:55,56; I John 2:1,2.

          <p className="text-jusitfy md:text-md pt-4">
            <span className='font font-semibold'>That Christ in the fullness of the blessings He has secured by His death and resurrection is received by faith alone</span>
            ; that the moment we trust in Him as our Saviour we pass out of death into everlasting life, justified from all things, accepted before the Father according to the measure of His acceptance, loved as He is loved, and one with Him. At the time of acceptance of Christ as Saviour, He comes to dwell within the believer and to live out His life of holiness and power through him. Ephesians 2:6-8; John 1:12; John 5:24; John 6:47; Acts 13:38,39; Romans 4:5,24,25; Romans 5:1; I Corinthians 1:30; John 17:21-23; Ephesians 1:6; Colossians 2:10; Hebrews 10:10-14; Ephesians 1:13; Ephesians 5:30,31; II Corinthians 13:5; Galatians 2:20; Colossians 1:27; I John 4:4; I John 5:18; I Corinthians 10:13; Jude 24.

            <span className='font font-semibold'>That the Church is composed of all those who truly believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour</span>
            ; it is the body and bride of Christ; that every believer is baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Spirit, whether Jew or Gentile, and thus being members of one another we are responsible to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, rising above all sectarian prejudices and denominational bigotry, and loving one another with a pure heart fervently. Ephesians 1:22,23; Ephesians 2:19-22; I Corinthians 12:12-27; I Corinthians 1:10-13; Romans 12:4,5; Ephesians 4:3-6; Ephesians 5:32; Philippians 2:1-5; Galatians 5:13-15.

            , and should abstain from such amusements and habits as will cause others to stumble or bring reproach upon the Cross of Christ. Believers are created in Christ Jesus unto good works. “As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith” (Galatians 6:10).

            , and there remain in conscious bliss until the resurrection of the body at His coming, when soul and body reunited shall be with Him forever in glory. Philippians 1:23; II Corinthians 5:1-8; II Corinthians 12:1-4; I Thessalonians 4:13,14; John 14:2,3; I Corinthians 15:35-57; Romans 8:23; I Thessalonians 4:15-18; Philippians 3:20,21; I John 3:2; Colossians 3:4; Hebrews 4:9; John 17:22-24.
