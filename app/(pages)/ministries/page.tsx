After School/In School Good News Clubs are designed to reach boys and girls in the elementary schools with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. These clubs are held immediately after school for one hour per week and are taught by teams of trained volunteers from local churches. Clubs include a Bible lesson, memory verse, missionary story, songs, prizes, and more.</p>

                  <p className="text-black dark:text-gray-400">Did you know that in Pennsylvania every child has the right to receive one hour of religious education per week? Released Time Class is a program in which children are released from school for one hour each week. These classes are held at local churches that are located in close proximity to elementary schools. During class, children sing songs, learn a Bible memory verse, hear a continuing missionary story, and most importantly, are taught a Bible lesson from Godâ€™s Word. </p>
